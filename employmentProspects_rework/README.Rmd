## Basic rework of the employment prospects app

Things I have changed:

* Rscripts containing functions are now sourced from the global.r script, rather than loaded from package.
* Data is also loaded in the global file rather than in the function. 
* Code for installing the package via github is commented out. 
* Code  `webshot::install_phamtom()` is also commented out - not sure if this is necessary.
